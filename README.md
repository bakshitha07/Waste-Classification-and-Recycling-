# Waste Classification and Recycling 

---

## ABSTRACT
 ---
 This project aims to develop a smart waste management system that handles waste classification, sorting, and recycling challenges using IoT, deep learning, and cloud computing. The Smart Waste Management System analyzes waste types in real-time and automates the entire process from collection to disposal. This system is a comprehensive solution with three modules that provides accurate waste detection, automated sorting, and user monitoring through a mobile app and LED display. Any user or facility just has to deploy the modules at waste points. The responses are precise about waste volume, contamination, and processing status. The user can monitor collection points, recycling facilities, and receive real-time alerts through the system. The user does not have to manually sort or track waste manually. The System analyzes waste through cameras and sensors, then sorts and notifies automatically. The user can also view analytics and receive status updates through an effective mobile app interface and 4-LED home module which feels like an intelligent assistant managing waste for you.
